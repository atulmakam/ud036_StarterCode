*BY ATUL NAGENDRA MAKAM*

# HOW IT WORKS

# REQUIREMENTS AND RELIABLES:

# CONTENTS:
1. media.py: python script which contains class Movie.
2. entertainment_center.py: main script where we run the program
3. fresh_tomatoes.py: creates HTML page for project. Default file provided by udacity, user can change it accordingly.
                   
# DETAILS
The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art  URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent your favorite movies and groups all the instances together in a list.

The Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.

# RUNNING THE CODE
 1. open the media.py and make changes if needed
 2. open the entertainment_center.py file and run the module
